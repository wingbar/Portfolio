    I'm a hardworking, outgoing person with a drive for programming. My entire life I've been an extremely quick learner with an intense hunger to just know how things work. What I lack in experience is made up in the fact that I'm incredibally eager to fully entrall myself in this field. There is nothing more gratifying to me than being able to see my ideas come to life in code.</div>
</p>

    <div>Heres a couple of projects that I've done.</div>
    <p></p>

    <p>MossRogue is a game I made in Java using GLSL shaders. The game has a dynamic lighting system and procedurally generated dungeon levels. There is different abilities you can do based on a regenerating mana system. You can download it on Itch.io <a href='https://wingbar.itch.io/mossrogue'>here.</a> The password is 'Veith'.</p>

    <p>The next project is a dynamic drawing app made in Javascript. You can change the number of squares to draw on with a slider. You can also click on colors to change them and edit their saturation.</p>

    <p>I made a movie app I made in Javascript and styled with CSS. I used the OMDb API to fetch movie names that the user inputs. Then, the user can do a quiz and test themselves to see how well they can guess the review scores.</p>
    <p>You can find my movie app and my drawing app on <a href="https://github.com/wingbar">my GitHub.</a></p>
